Hint:  Type ./DOP.pl -Hn where n is a number from 0 to 9 for more verbose help.
            ./DOP.pl -Zn for explanation of how values calculated (n=0)
Usage:
 ./DOP.pl [-h] [-Hn] [-OW|E] [-R<spec>] [-i infile_name ] [-o reportfile_name] -d<deal_num> -D<dbg_level> -R<DS>\
    [-W<spades>/<hearts>/<diam>/<clubs>] [-E<spades>/<hearts>/<diam>/<clubs>] [-w<list>] [-e<list>] \
    -A[N|S|D] -l[C|D|H|S] -r[C|D|H|S]
    The last three (-A, -l, -r) apply only to (adjusted) DOP when they open the bidding.
If neither W nor E hand is specified on the cmd line, the program attempts to read from stdin.
Type -H4 to get fmt of stdin file.

In the above cmd line invocation:
-O defines who opens the bidding, E or W. The default is W.
    This affects which hand can count shape points before a trump fit is found.
-R defines the type of report to produce. The Default is SN. Deal=Summary, Hand=None Other Combos SS, SD, DS, DD.
-W<string> and -E<string> define the cards in the West and East hands.
    Enter both hands or one hand only. If none is entered the program attempts to read from stdin.
-w<list> and -e<list> define the strains and declarer for which to produce an evaluation report.
   The default is nothing. <list> is a series of comma separated letters from the set [C D H S N L]
   The Strain evaluation gives more detail especially re the DFIT pts, and the number of tricks "expected".
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the above cmd line invocation: ...
-W<spades>/<hearts>/<diamonds>/<clubs> refers to the definition of the corresponding hand:
   This example : -WAJT23,567,KQ109,7  -EKxxx/a5Q6k10/--/qjXXXXX
   Demonstrates that:
   a) the order of the cards in a suit does not matter. It will however look funny in your reports.
   b) You can use either 10 or T to represent a Ten. 10 is converted to T which is used thereafter.
   c) You can enter in upper or lower case. Upper X's are converted to x, other lowers are converted to upper.
   d) you can enter voids with dashes
   e) you can use either slashes (/) or commas(,) to separate the suits.
   f) you can enter invalid hands. The program will error check and reject them.
Aside:
   g) When giving compass directions, you can enter S(south) as a synonym for W, and N(north) as a synonym for E.
      But W and E will show in reports.
      ditto for "s" as a synonym for "w" and "n" as a synonym for "e".

   <list> (in the terms -w<list> or -e<list>) is comma seperated letters chosen from N,S,H,D,C,L
   These letters represent the strain(s) that you want the program to report details about.
   Example -wN,L -eN,S,D
   The above says to evaluate the hands and produce reports for the following:
   a) East is Declaring NT, b) East is Declaring in Spades, c) East is Declaring in Diamonds
   d) West is Declaring NT, e) West is Declaring in the E/W Longest fit.
   If no Strain option is specified then the program defaults to no strain level detail.
   These Strain details are not crucial:
   both the Deal Summary, and the Hand Summary provide more detail than you really need,
   Not to mention the Deal Detail and Hand Detail report.
R=<spec>
   <spec> is the level of detail to be reported. It is one of: S|D|SS|SD|DS|DD
   Giving the level of detail reported for the deal (both hands) and/or Hand(s) individually as:
   i) S=Deal Summary,  ii) D=Deal Summary and Deal Detail
   iii) SS=Deal Summary and Hand Summary, iv) SD=Deal Summary and Hand Detail
   v) DS=Deal Summary and Detail plus Hand Summary  vi) DD=Summary and Detail for both Deal and Hand(s)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Entering one or both hands from the cmd line is a quick and easy way to evaluate one deal or hand.
However if you want to evaluate a series of hands you might want to prepare a file of deals and
have it redirected to the program's STDIN.

   Example: DOP_eval -eS,H -wL,N -RDS <dealfile.dat >dealfile.rpt
or you can use the -i and -o options:
            DOP_eval -eS,H -wL,N -RDS -i dealfile.dat  -o dealfile.rpt

This tells the program to read the hands from: dealfile.dat write the reports to: dealfile.rpt
Note that if using STDIN you cannot specify ANY deal on the cmd line.
Options you enter on the cmd line become the default options unless overridden in the detail file.
The above example sets the default opener to be East (rather than West)
and the default East strains to be the majors, (rather than nothing), the default Report to be DS
These defaults can still be overriden on a deal by deal basis from the line in the data file.

********************************************************************************************
IMPORTANT NOTE: ********* Dealfile must have EOF as the last line in the file.  ************
if you do not do this the last deal line in the file will not be processed. (Mild Bug?)
********************************************************************************************

Here is a sample line from a deal data file:
d=6 W=AJ62,KT,AK963,A5 E=74/QJ984/Q/QJ632 O=W w=C,N e=H, R=DD T=Challenge problem 4.

(Note there are NO minus signs (-) before the 'switches'
instead the switches are followed by equal signs (=). i.e. d=6 NOT -d6 or -d=6

Analyzing Deals solved by GIB
As a verification tool for the DOP method, we can refer to a Database of over 100K deals solved by the GIB DD solver.
We can then see how often DOP's estimated tricks compare to those that are actually possible on the given deal.
The -G switch gives a filename which contains the deals, and possible tricks, in a GIB/PBN format.
This gibdeal file is NOT a full blown PBN file; rather it contains one line per deal, this line has a text string
giving the cards in each hand, and 20 chars at the end of the line that specify how many tricks NS can take
in each of the five strains.
#GIB line (87 Chars) = T5.K4.652.A98542 K6.QJT976.QT7.Q6 432.A.AKJ93.JT73 AQJ987.8532.84.K:65658888888843433232
#                      S   H  D    C     S   H     D   C   S K  D     C     S      H   D C[.NT..Sp..He..Di..Cl.]
#                      <--- West------>  <--- North ---> <---- East-----> <--- South ---->[leader = s,e,n,w for each]
# suits separated by DOTs, Compass separated by SPACE , COLON marks end of cards, start of tricks.
# tricks are given for NS 5 sets of 4 chars [0-9A-D]; 1st set = NT, then S,H,D,C; each set dealer=s,e,n,w

DOP does not care about the leader so this pgm just compares the number of tricks estimated by DOP
with the highest number in each strain.
DOP in Competition (They Open): aka Adjusted Optimal Count.
   To evaluate a hand or pair of hands in competitive auctions you first evaluate the hands normally to come up with the DOP.
   Then you adjust the DOP for length or shortness and Lone Kings, Lone Jacks, and KQ combos  in their suits,
   The adjustments for length depend on whether Intervenor intends to intervene with NT OCall, T/O DBL, or suit OCall.
   You also adjust for Lone Kings and Lone Jacks in 3 or 4 card side suits; i.e. NOT their suits.
   A lone King or Lone Jack means no card higher than a 9 in that suit; i.e. KT(x) or JT(x) no Adjustment.

   Accordingly we have the extra cmd line arguments:
   -A[NSD] which specifies No AOP report, Summary AOP report, and Detail AOP report.
   -r[CDHSN] (RHO) and -l[CDHSN] (LHO) with the strain that they bid.
   i.e. -rz or -lz which states whether the Opener is on our right (we are behind him)  or left (he is over us).
   "z" is the strain he opened in: C,D,H,S,N (or c,d,h,s,n). So -rs RHO opened in Spades. -lN LHO opened in NT.
   It is possible that both RHO and LHO will be bidding different suits as in (1D) - P - (1S) - 2H
   Our RHO has bid spades and our LHO has bid Diamonds so we enter -rS, -lD on the cmd line.

   In competitive auctions "Opener" for our side is in fact, "Intervenor", but it is not worth going thru the whole program
   to change this. So in Competitive auctions "Opener" means the first hand to bid for our side.
   In order to keep the option of allowing any compass direction to be our Opener we don't specify the compass direction
   for their side; we just specify RHO or LHO relative to our side's first bidder.
